# BmcaOS
BmcaOS: a open-source, DOS-style operating system that can (hopefully) run basic operating environments like Windows 3.1 on top. This is made Complete From Scratch (NOT https://scratch.mit.edu/) and a lot of work was put into this! Also, absolute HUGE thanks to George for the idea and kernel (profile: https://github.com/GeorgeZ787)
